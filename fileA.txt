To fix 
Remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/leedustins/learningGit.git/'

This is happening because remote origin is set to https. Need to change it to SSH
Confirm this is the issue with
git remote -v

To change 
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

test
